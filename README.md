Approximatly every 3 years, the EPA releases its database on emissions of PM2.5. This database is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). The overall goal of this project is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database and see what it says about fine particulate matter pollution in the United states over the 10-year period 1999â€“2008.
